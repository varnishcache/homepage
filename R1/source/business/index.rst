How to get your company on this list
------------------------------------

When I put this page up I hadn't really thought it through.

There are a *lot* of companies offering Varnish hosting and services
and I was not planning to maintain a comprehensive directory of
them all here.

Experience shows that companies forget to tell when they go out of business,
move, change names or drop products, and therefore such lists either takes
a lot of effort or end up having negative utility.

An obvious solution would be some kind of self-registration system where
entries expire if people don't update them, but that would be an invitation
for spammers and I don't have the time (or skills) to write such a facility
anyway.

So instead I have raised the bar:  To get listed here, a company
must have contributed back to the Varnish Cache Project in a
meaningful way.

Send email to phk@ if you think your company qualifies.
