Getting Help
============

If you need help with Varnish and the docs give you no clue on what
to do there are several options available to you.

Mailing lists
-------------

The varnish-misc list is open for questions.

There are other lists available as well, but those have other
purposes. See `Mailman </lists/mailman/listinfo>`_ for a complete listing.

IRC Channel
-----------

Internet Relay Chat (IRC), the multiuser, real time instant messaging service, is available. A lot of Varnish users hang out here and help is often given in a friendly manner. You need to connect to the channel #varnish on the server irc.linpro.no.

Social Media
------------

Varnish is also discussed in a number of social media. Here is a overview:

* Stack Overflow, where there is a `varnish <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/varnish?sort=newest&pageSize=40>`_ and a `varnish-vcl <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/varnish-vcl?sort=newest&pageSize=40>`_ tag
* Linkedin has a `varnish topic <https://www.linkedin.com/topic/varnish-cache>`_ and a `Varnish Cache Group <https://www.linkedin.com/groups/855677>`_.
* Twitter is a good place to reach us out. You can find us as `@varnishcache <https://twitter.com/varnishcache>`_.
