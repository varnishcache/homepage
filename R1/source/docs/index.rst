Varnish Documentation
=====================

The official documentation contains a **install guide**, a **tutorial**
and a **reference**.

We're trying to keep the official documentation in sync with the code.
Both are kept in same source repository and both are available online:

-  `Documentation for the latest release
   6.0 <https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/6.0/>`__
-  `Documentation for
   5.2 <https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/5.2/>`__

-  `Documentation for the stable release
   4.1 <https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/4.1/>`__
