Varnish Documentation
=====================

The official documentation contains a **install guide**, a **tutorial**
and a **reference**.

We're trying to keep the official documentation in sync with the code.
Both are kept in same source repository and both are available online:

-  `Documentation for the latest release
   6.2 </docs/6.2/>`__
-  `Documentation for the latest release
   6.1 </docs/6.1/>`__
-  `Documentation for the latest release
   6.0 </docs/6.0/>`__
-  `Documentation for
   5.2 </docs/5.2/>`__
-  `Documentation for
   5.1 </docs/5.1/>`__
-  `Documentation for the stable release
   4.1 </docs/4.1/>`__
-  `Documentation for the deprecated release
   4.0 </docs/4.0/>`__
-  `Documentation for old version
   3.0 </docs/3.0/>`__ (unsupported)
-  `Documentation for older version
   2.1 </docs/2.1/>`__ (unsupported)
-  `Documentation for the current development
   version </docs/trunk/>`__ (git master)
