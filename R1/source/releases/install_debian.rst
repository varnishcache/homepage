Installation on Debian and Ubuntu
=================================

Varnish Cache is distributed in the Debian and Ubuntu package repositories.

The versions there might be out of date, but they provide a simple and elegant
way of getting started with Varnish Cache.

::

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $Â sudo apt-get install varnish


Official packages of 5.0
------------------------

Starting from Varnish Cache 5.0, we've simplified our packaging down to two:
the main package and a development package.

The official Varnish Cache repository is now hosted at Packagecloud.io.

are available at https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/varnish50/install#deb
