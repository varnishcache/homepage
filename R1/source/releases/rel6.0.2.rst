* The packaging of this release differs slightly from previous Varnish versons. This is described in the `upgrading notes </docs/6.0/whats-new/upgrading-6.0.html#packaging-changes>`_ for 6.0. These changes were originally intended for the initial 6.0 release, but unfortunately they did not make it into the 6.0.0 or 6.0.1 packages.
