Edit 1: Changed license to be granted to `CC BY`_
-------------------------------------------------

2025-11-03:

We originally published the contest asking for entries to be made available
under CC BY-NC-SA license. After publication, it was pointed out to us that this
license was prohibitive for inclusion of the logo in some software distributions
and could be problematic, for example, for use in commercially distributed
books. We do want to allow such uses and, consequently, reduced the license
requirement to `CC BY`_, even if it does not restrict commercial use and might
allow some commercial use cases which we did originally want to prevent.

Edit 2: Clarification of the Vinyl Cache logo competition
---------------------------------------------------------

2025-11-06:

Please read the long story below if you can, but first things first: We called
for participation in a competition and learned that the idea was bad and our
communication insufficient. We do not want to retract the competition, so we
want to (try to) remedy the situation with these clarifications and additions to
the rules:

- Please regard the competition as a pitch: Our intention is to see your ideas -
  we do not need polished, finalized work, but rather drafts or sketches and
  some idea of how your finished designs usually looks like. This can be in the
  form of some examples or a portfolio.

  To be clear, please submit:

  * (A) your drafts/sketches of

    * (A1) Logotype and logomark *and/or*

    * (A2) Mascot

    and

  * (B) your portfolio or other examples of your finished designs.

- The selection process will be guided not by how finished your entries are, but
  rather by originality and how well your ideas represent our project, given
  that you showed that you are able to finalize your work.

To make clear that we want to reward the tedious work of finalizing drafts, we
will first grant the same price of 250€ (for logo and mascot) or 125€ + 125€
(for logo or mascot) to all 3-6 best entries as submitted.

We will then work with the first winner for logo and/or mascot, respectively, to
finalize their work and pay out the remaining 750€ (for logo and mascot) or 375€
+ 375€ (for logo or mascot) for the final design.

*Now for the rest of the back story*

Elena Rossini was so kind to share our call for participation in this competition
to create a logo and mascot for the rebranded Vinyl Cache project. Some
commentators to `her post <https://mastodon.social/@_elena/115490522590026262>`_
pointed out that competitions among designers were generally frowned upon and
considered exploitative.

To clarify, we are not Varnish Software, but the newly founded
Vinyl Cache Association, consisting of currently three members only. The
monetary prizes are donated by one of the companies who have contributed
significantly to the project under the old name for the past 15 years.

We thank those who pointed out issues with our competition and specifically
those who made constructive suggestions. We as technical people have learned a
lot and understand that the competition idea was not a good one. There is a
matching saying in German: "Gut gemeint ist noch lange nicht gut gemacht"
(similar to "Good intentions don't make you right", but more as "done right").

To explain our intentions:

As individuals, employees and a small company, we have worked with
designers in the past, who we could have approached and paid
directly. The competition idea was motivated by the desire to open up our
newfound project and leave our small bubble.

In our perception, work on the project logo & mascot would be a FOSS
contribution as per this rule from :ref:`the contest text <logo_contest>`
(slightly edited for clarity):

  - By entering designs into the contest, you promise to make [the finalized
    version] available under the CC BY license if selected as a winner. Note that
    the Vinyl Cache project will have the same rights as everyone else.

So we specifically do not ask for a transfer of any rights to us, but rather to
grant rights to everyone as per `CC BY`_. We specifically do not ask for
transfer of any rights on non-selected works.

One comment pointed out that the "proper way" (our words) to make logo/mascot
work a FOSS contribution was to organize it fully in the open and allow public
voting. We think that the people who run the project and make most of the
contributions should have the privilege to decide on how the project presents
itself, and hence we think that the members of the newly found Vinyl Cache
association should have the vote.

We saw the monetary prizes as an added bonus, but we understand that this train
of thought was still not perceived as intended. We are sorry. We do not want to
exploit designers and will (try hard to) not make such a mistake again.

Since the competition is out, we need to deal with it. Having announced it, we
want to stand by what we said we would do, and we want to avoid retrospectively
changing the rules too much. If the competition fails with no (good) entries,
this will be entirely our fault and we will come up with a better second try.

If you want to participate, please show us your ideas. You do not need to
finalize them, please only put in the amount of work which you deem acceptable.
We will ask only with winner(s) to deliver finished designs.
