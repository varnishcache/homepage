Edit 1: Changed license to be granted to `CC BY`_
-------------------------------------------------

2025-11-03:

We originally published the contest asking for entries to be made available
under CC BY-NC-SA license. After publication, it was pointed out to us that this
license was prohibitive for inclusion of the logo in some software distributions
and could be problematic, for example, for use in commercially distributed
books. We do want to allow such uses and, consequently, reduced the license
requirement to `CC BY`_, even if it does not restrict commercial use and might
allow some commercial use cases which we did originally want to prevent.
