What is happening
-----------------

2019-02-20 - Maintenance release: Varnish Cache 6.0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are happy to announce the release of :ref:`rel6.0.3`.

This maintenance release is recommended for all users of the 6.0 LTS
and contains several bug fixes, improvements and new features. More
information is available in the
`Change log <https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/blob/6.0/doc/changes.rst>`_

2019-02-11 - Maintenance release: Varnish Cache 4.1.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are happy to announce the release of :ref:`rel4.1.11`.

This maintenance release is recommended for all users of 4.0 and 4.1 versions,
and contains several bug fixes. More information is available in the
`Change log <https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/blob/4.1/doc/changes.rst>`_

2018-11-12 - Varnish 6.0.2 released, official Long Term Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are happy to announce the release of :ref:`rel6.0.2`.

This release is recommended for everyone running 6.0, and it contains
many bug fixes and some new features.

At the same time we bring you the news that that 6.0 will maintained
much longer than other Varnish Cache Releases, and that new
repositories, Varnish 6.0 LTS, are introduced.

If you are currently using official packages, you need to change to
the new LTS repositories to get 6.0.2. Please follow the instructions
on the release page to set up the new repository for your platform.

The packaging of this release differs slightly from previous Varnish
versons. This is described in the
`upgrading notes <docs/6.0/whats-new/upgrading-6.0.html#packaging-changes>`_
for 6.0. These changes were originally intended for the initial 6.0
release, but unfortunately they did not make it into the 6.0.0 or
6.0.1 packages.

At some point the previous LTS, Varnish 4.1, will reach its End of
Life. It was first released in September 2015, and now is the time
for users to start upgrading to Varnish 6.0 LTS.

If you are still using Varnish 4.1, you should be able to migrate to
6.0 without touching your VCL.  In our experience so far, upgrading is
very straightforward.

and `what's new </docs/6.0/whats-new/changes-6.0.html>`_ in Varnish

2018-06-08 - Publically available packages from UPLEX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The varnish-cache contributors from `UPLEX`_ are happy to announce an
alternative source for varnish binary packages for Debian, Ubuntu and
RHEL/CentOS (work in progress).

Debian/Ubuntu packages are based on fairly recent varnish-cache master
snapshots and are expected to be updated on a bi-weekly basis,
synchronized with the official varnish-cache weekly builds.

The main purpose of the `UPLEX Packages`_ is to provide simple and
efficient access to up-to-date varnish builds and a matching range of
additional vmods which are not commonly found in package repositories
like `blobdigest`_, `re`_, `re2`_, `geoip2`_ and `dcs`_ in addition to
the `varnish-modules`_ vmod bundle. Other will be added over time.

This packaging effort is still in its early stages and will grow over time.
