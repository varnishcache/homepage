Migrating Varnish versions
==========================

This page is a continuous work in progress, and contributions to it
are very much welcomed. Do not hesitate to open a "pull request" on
`our GitHub repository <https://github.com/varnishcache/homepage/>`.

The following resources document upgrades from unsupported versions:

* `Migrating from 3.0.x to 4.0.x
  </docs/4.1/whats-new/upgrade-4.0.html>`_
* `Migrating to 4.1.x </docs/4.1/whats-new/upgrading.html>`_
* `Upgrading to 5.0 </docs/6.0/whats-new/upgrading-5.0.html>`_
* `Upgrading to 5.1 </docs/6.0/whats-new/upgrading-5.1.html>`_
* `Upgrading to 5.2 </docs/6.0/whats-new/upgrading-5.2.html>`_
* `Upgrading to 6.0 </docs/6.0/whats-new/upgrading-6.0.html>`_

Releases after 6.0 do not come with Long Time Support, but are
released as "fresh". A "fresh" release will get security updates for a
while, but not general bug fixes. A release can be promoted to LTS in
a separate announcement, and it will then receive general bug fixes
and some new features from newer releases and development.

Updating to the latest releases are documented here:

* `Upgrading to 6.1 </docs/trunk/whats-new/upgrading-6.1.html>`_
* `Upgrading to 6.2 </docs/trunk/whats-new/upgrading-6.2.html>`_
* `Upgrading to 6.3 </docs/trunk/whats-new/upgrading-6.3.html>`_

Upgrading from 4.x to the latest LTS should be very straightforward,
and require much less effort than going to 3.x to 4.x.

Versions of the VCL language
============================

Currently there are two official versions of the VCL language, 4.0 and
